local repositories are found on a users computer and remote repos are hosted on a hosting service in the cloud. They use ssh or https to authenticate, in order to initialize a remote repo you can either use the [[git init]] to create a local repo and push it onto a remote repo or start with a remote repo and cloning it onto your computer to make a local repo. important to note that neither of these repos affect each other automatically you need to manually use git commands to affect one when working from the other.
