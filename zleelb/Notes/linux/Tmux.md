Three main components:
- Sessions: Logical unit which is basically a working environment dedicated to a task or a divider like session for work and session for personal use
- Windows: Same as a tab in a browser, optional a lot of people simply use one window per session
- Panes: A single instance of a shell running, and can be split vertically or horizontally like a window in vscode or in neovim
