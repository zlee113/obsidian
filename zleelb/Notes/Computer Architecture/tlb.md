### Translation Lookaside Buffer

- Address translation: Virtual addresses are generated by the CPU must be translated to physical addresses in RAM
- Performance: Accessing the page table in memory can be slow, TLB caches recent translations to speed up the process

##### Structure
- Entries (its a table)
	- Virtual page number: Part of the virtual address that identifies the page
	- Physical Frame number: Corresponding physical address frame
	- Flags for permission, dirty, or valid bits
##### How it works
- Virtual address generated by CPU and divided into virtual page number and the offset (part in the page)
- TLB lookup: Memory management unit checks TLB to see if virtual page number is present
	- if found physical frame number is retrieved
	- if not found mmu consults page table in memory
		- updates tlb with retrieval from page table
		- tlb may employ a replacement policy like least recently used
