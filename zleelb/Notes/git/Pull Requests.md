Pull requests AKA Merge Requests based on the [[hosting service]]. Feature of hosting services (so not git) to collaborate and get feed back, essentially code reviews. 

The request has nine steps:
1. Create a branch in the local repo
2. Add work through commits
3. Push commits to remote repo
4. Create the Pull or Merge request
5. Have others review and incorporate feedback
6. Have the request approved
7. Merge the request
8. If the branch is an offshoot or feature branch you can delete the branch to clean up
9. Pull changes to sync local repo and clean up local
